Middleware
    In between request and response middleware exists

path
    this can be used to create a path
    path has join method, with the help of this the path can be constructed
    when constructing path, we need to follow this approach because, in different operating system the slash will be different
        so this path check our OS and construct the path depending on that

__dirname
    global variable provided by Node JS, it gives absolute path on our operating system


public folder
    This folder is accessible publically by everyone
    If we point the path of this folder in brower url we should be able to see the content

    we can have multiple public folder, but name of the folder should be different
