Different types of error
    Technical/Network error
        Ex. MongoDB server may be down
    Expected error
        Ex. File cant be read, database operation fails
    Bugs/Logical error
        Ex. User object used when it doesnot exist

Working with errors
    For synchronous code
        try-catch
    For asynchronous code
        then()-catch()

We can also use error handling middleware to work with errors
