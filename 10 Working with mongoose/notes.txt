Mongoose
    A Object Document Mapping library

Core concepts
    We use schemas and models
    we have instances, which is used to instantiate the model
    Based on that instances we can run our queries

.save()
    To save a document into a database

.find()
    To get all the documents

.populate()
    Tells mongoose to populate certain field with all the details

    populate("userId", "name")
        populate details based on userId field and fetch only name field information from that

.execPopulate()
    To execute a query defined inside populate and return a promise
    It should be appended after the populate method
    For older version of mongoose it required, for newer version it is not neccessary

.select() 
    To select some field out of many fields while fetching information
    .select("title price -_id")
    Here include tilte and price and exclude _id
    To exclude we prepend it with -(minus)

    The same thing can be done inside populate also

._doc
    TO get the entire document based on _id
    Ex. item.productId._doc
