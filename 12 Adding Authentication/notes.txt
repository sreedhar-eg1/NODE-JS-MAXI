While storing password we need to encrypt the password
    we can achieve this with a package "npm i bcryptjs"

    the password encrypted using this dependency cannot be decrypted

CSRF Attacks
    CSRF => Cross-Site Request Forgery
    User is tricked to another site instead of using the actual site
    To avoid this we need to use CSRF token

    we can use dependency for this "npm i csrf-csrf"

We can add some information to the every rendered view
    that is using special field provided by the express js
        that special field is "locals"

we need to add csrf token to all the post route to make sure that our session is not stolen

If we want to make use of session to display flash message then we can use "npm i connect-flash" package
