MongoDB
    can store lots and lots of data

.insertOne()
    To insert a single documents

.insertMany()
    To insert multiple documents

.find()
    without anything inside find() method it returns everything
    but to get all documents at once we need to use .toArray() 

.next()
    It will give the last element as an array

In mongoDb, id is stored in some different format
    so to compare the id, we need to create a new objectId which is got from the mongoDb
    const mongodb = require('mongodb')
    new mongodb.ObjectId('any_id')
