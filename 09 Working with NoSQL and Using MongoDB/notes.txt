MongoDB
    can store lots and lots of data

.insertOne()
    To insert a single documents

.insertMany()
    To insert multiple documents

.find()
    without anything inside find() method it returns everything
    but to get all documents at once we need to use .toArray() 

.next()
    It will give the last element as an array
    In some cases while fetching documents all elements will not be returned at once, instead a cursor will be returned
    so by navigating the cursor the prodict get loaded

    so if only one element is needed then next() can be used otherwise we can use toArray()

In mongoDb, id is stored in some different format
    so to compare the id, we need to create a new objectId which is got from the mongoDb
    const mongodb = require('mongodb')
    new mongodb.ObjectId('any_id') 

while updating the document using updateOne or insertMany
    we need to use the keyword $set to replace the existing document
