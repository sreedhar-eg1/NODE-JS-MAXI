Stream
    Here data is parsed in chunks
    For example, the data that we are using is too large, such that these data is divided into chunks(smaller parts), so we can work
    with this smaller part instead of waiting for all the data to be available and perform the operation

Buffer
    The problem is we can't work directly with chuck. so we need a Buffer
    Buffer is like a bus stop
    Means hold multiple chunk and work with them, after we done with work on that chunk, release them and move to the next
    chunk
