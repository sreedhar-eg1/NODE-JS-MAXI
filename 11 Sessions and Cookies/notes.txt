With cookie we can store data in browser which is customized for that particular user only

we can set a cookie just by setting a header, with header name as 'Set-Cookie'
and the value for that header can be any key-value pair
         res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'loggedIn=true')

To get the Cookie information
    req.get('Cookie')

One disadvantage of using cookie is, we can manipulate or change its value in the frontend
    so it wont be a good solution to store sensitive information
    To solve this we can use sessions

session
    Cookie will store information in the Client where as the sessions is stored in the server
    To use session we need to use 3rd party package "npm i express-session"

There are many ways to store session details
    here we are using "npm i connect-mongodb-session"
